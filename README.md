# 🧩 Tile Master

**Tile Master** is a casual visual puzzle game — and my very first web development project — built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. The goal is simple: identify and click the tile that has a different color than the rest. As you progress, the difficulty increases by making the color difference subtler.

🌐 **Live Demo**: [tilemaster.vercel.app](https://tilemaster.vercel.app/)

## 🎮 How to Play

- A board of tiles appears with all tiles of the same color — except one.
- Your task: **find and click the odd-colored tile**.
- With each level, it gets harder to visually spot the difference.

> A fun and challenging way to test your observation skills!
